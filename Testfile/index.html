	<h4>1.1 - Purpose of the study</h4>

	<p>This study aims to investigate the cognitive process of experiencing a film edit. It will specifically look at the match-action editing technique and how visual continuum (i.e. where the eye is led on-screen) across cuts affects the viewer’s experience and can lead to the phenomenon of edit blindness (i.e. not noticing a cut has happened). Doing so might allow us to further understand film language in order to try and expand on it. It might also bring further understanding of the science behind it as well as on the cognitive process of viewing a piece of film.</p>

	<h4>1.2 - Experiment Overview</h4>

	<p>This study will have 3 different sections:</p>
	<p>Section 1: You will be tasked with detecting edits in a piece of film.</p>
	<p>Section 2: You will be tasked to choose, from a set of different clips, which edit is the “smoothest” (i.e. least noticeable).</p>
	<p>Section 3: You will have to answer a short questionnaire concerning your personal knowledge of film, your experience with this experiment and other personal information.</p>

	<h4>1.3 - Privacy</h4>
	
	<p>Any information that you submit for use in this project will remain anonymous. Your personal information will not be used with specific references to you. Participants of this project will only be referred to as “participants” within the write up of this project. All information gathered is for comparative purposes, not to assess any one individual.</p>

	<h4>1.3 - Preferred Experiment Conditions</h4>
	
	<p>Make sure you’ve opened the link using Google Chrome and have the web page opened in full screen. Make sure that your keyboard’s space bar is fully functioning and have a decent internet connection in order for the videos to play without buffering.</p>
